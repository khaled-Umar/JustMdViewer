## Features

- **Tabs in one window.** Each file opens in its own tab. Opening a file while the app is running adds a tab to the existing window instead of starting a second copy.
- **Picks up where you left off.** The tabs from your last session reopen on start, each with its scroll position and outline state. Files you open at start are added as extra tabs.
- **GitHub-like rendering** (Markdig): tables, task lists, footnotes, alerts, emoji and syntax-highlighted code.
- **Copy anything**: select and copy text, or use the one-click **Copy** button on code blocks.
- **Safe links**: web links never open silently. A dialog shows the website and the full address first, and warns about look-alike international names and `user@host` tricks. Links to other local Markdown files open in a new tab.
- **Outline**: a collapsible tree of the headings that you can hide and show again without losing its state.
- **Light, Dark or System theme**, from the header or with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>.
- **Auto-reload** when the file changes on disk, plus **find**, **zoom** and **print**.
- **Relative local images** resolve next to the open file.
- **Hardened against untrusted documents**: sanitized HTML, a strict Content Security Policy, and no script execution from documents.
- **No telemetry.** The app makes no network requests of its own; the only traffic comes from images a document references by URL.

## Install

1. Download `JustMdViewer-Setup-<version>.exe` (2.8 MB) from the [latest release](https://github.com/khaled-Umar/JustMdViewer/releases/latest).
2. Run it. It installs for the current user by default; you can choose an all-users install instead. The installer is not code-signed yet, so **Windows SmartScreen may warn you**: choose *More info*, then *Run anyway*.
3. Pick the options:
   - **Associate Markdown files (.md, .markdown) with JustMdViewer** (ticked)
   - **Add 'Open with JustMdViewer' to the right-click menu of Markdown files** (ticked). On Windows 11 the entry appears under **Show more options**.
   - **Create a desktop shortcut** (not ticked)

If another app already opens Markdown files, Windows keeps it as the default and may ask you once which app to use. Choose JustMdViewer and *Always*, or set it in Settings > Apps > Default apps.

**Requirements**

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit. The app is a single x64 build; on Arm PCs it runs through Windows' x64 emulation.
- [.NET 10 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) **x64** (also on Arm PCs). The installer warns you if it is missing and offers to open the download page. The installer is small because the app is framework-dependent.
- [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/), already present on Windows 11 and most Windows 10 PCs. The installer warns you if it is missing.

## Usage

Open files with the **+** button or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>, by double-clicking an associated file, from the right-click menu, by dropping files on the window, or by passing paths on the command line. The header holds the outline toggle, the tab strip, the **+** button and the theme toggle.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> | Open files |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> | Close tab |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PgDn</kbd> | Next tab |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PgUp</kbd> | Previous tab |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> … <kbd>9</kbd> | Go to tab 1–9 |
| <kbd>F5</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> | Reload |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> | Find |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> | Show or hide the outline |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> | Switch theme (System → Light → Dark) |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> | Zoom in / out |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd> | Reset zoom |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> | Print |

## Build from source

Requires Windows and the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0).

```powershell
dotnet build JustMdViewer.sln -c Release
dotnet test
```

To produce the full package, install [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) and run the build script with PowerShell 7:

```powershell
pwsh ./build.ps1            # options: -Version 1.2.0, -SkipTests, -SkipInstaller
```

It runs the tests, publishes the app to `artifacts/publish`, and writes `artifacts/installer/JustMdViewer-Setup-<version>.exe` with a `.sha256` checksum next to it.

## Project layout
